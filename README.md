# Football-Manager---Wonderkids---10-year-Simulation
The project aims at finding out the best wonder-kid in Football Manager 2020 under the age of 21. 


Step by Step process excercised to achieve this result.

1. Created a new game.
2. Used In-Game Editor to identify players under the age of 21 and with potential ability equal or more than 155.
3. Shortlisted them.
4. In the player shortlist panel, used attributes view i.e. Goalkeeping, Mental, Physical, Technical and Hidden Attributes. Also included value column.  (Pro Tip - Save the view)
5. Click on FM (Top right corner), and select print screen. Save as a web page.
6. Open the webpage. You can see the players with all in-game attributes.
7. Transfer the table to excel.
8. I did some modulation to find out the Goalkeeping, Mental, Physical, Technical and Hidden attributes's scores. This allows for an easy comparison with other players.
9. This will provide the base for the simulations. 
10. Go to FM. Start a 5 year simulation.
11. After 5 years, go to your player shortlist panel. Perform the same operation as before to list down all attributes. The saved view cannot be used in shortlist panel. So you'll have to manually create the same view again. After completion, use the print screen option to export out the data.
12. Now you can transfer the new 5 year simulated data, to a new sheet in the same excel file for comparison.
13. Go to Fm. Start another 5 year simulation.
14. After total of 10 years, perform the same operations as before to export out the data from the game.
15. After creating another sheet with the new data i.e after 10 years what is the growth of all the earlier scouted wonder kids.
16. U can perform simple comparitive analyses to identify the best pick for your save and your team.
17. Have fun playing with all the data and get the best players at their prime because you'll already know when they'll hit their prime.

Further updation coming in future :-

1. Using ML based trained model to predict a wonder-kid's growth from young age. This will be extremely helpful when new gens are generated later in the game. You will be able to identify the future prodigies of the game even before they know it that they are gonna make it big.
